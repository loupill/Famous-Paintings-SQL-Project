# Famous-Paintings-SQL-Project

This project's SQL queries delve into analyzing famous paintings and related entities such as museums and artists. Queries are designed to uncover insights such as identifying paintings not currently displayed in any museums and museums without any paintings. Additionally, the analysis includes assessing pricing dynamics, like identifying paintings with asking prices below 50% of their regular price and determining the canvas size with the highest cost. Furthermore, the queries aim to ensure data integrity by identifying museums with potentially invalid city information. The project also explores the most popular painting subjects by fetching the top 10 most frequently occurring themes, offering valuable insights into trends and preferences within the dataset.
